## Motivation

With the massive industry that is e-commerce, it only felt natural to devote time to developing and understanding a full-stack e-commerce platform. As such, I decided to follow [Brad Traversy's Udemy MERN Stack E-Commerce](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-ecommerce/) course and gain an in-depth understanding of this very common design pattern.
